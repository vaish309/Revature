<h1>You are loading ads after page load using setTimeout.
 Why does the ad load after the main content even if the timeout is 0ms?
</h1>
<h3> 
<h2>Explaination:</h2> 
Even if setTimeout is set to 0ms, the ad loads after the main content
because JavaScript first completes all synchronous code on the Call Stack.
The setTimeout callback is handled by the browser and placed in the Callback Queue,
not executed immediately. 
The Event Loop only moves this callback to the Call Stack after the stack is empty, 
which happens once the main page content has finished loading,
so the ad always appears after the main content.
</h3>

<script>
console.log("Main content rendering");

setTimeout(() => {
  console.log("Loading ads...");
}, 0);

console.log("Page fully loaded");
