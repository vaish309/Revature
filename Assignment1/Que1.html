<h2> Call Stack & Event Loop
A web page has a button that logs "Start", then uses setTimeout to log "Async Task", and finally logs "End".
 Explain the execution order using Call Stack, Callback Queue, and Event Loop.</h2>


 <h2> Explaination</h2>
 <h3>
    When the button is clicked, the function starts executing on the Call Stack.
    First, "Start" is logged because synchronous code runs immediately.
    Then setTimeout is sent to the browser’s Web API,
    so its callback does not run right away and is placed in the
    Callback Queue after the timer finishes. Next, "End" is logged
    because it is also synchronous.
    After all synchronous code is done and the Call Stack becomes empty, 
    the Event Loop moves the callback from the Callback Queue to the Call Stack,
    and finally "Async Task" is logged.

  console.log("Start");

  setTimeout(() => {
    console.log("Async Task");
  }, 0);
